# Cloud Run Integration Summary

## Changes Made for Cloud Run Deployment

### 1. Frontend Upgrades
- Updated `frontend/app.py` to detect Cloud Run environment using `K_SERVICE` and use a different backend URL
- Created `frontend/.env.cloud` with Cloud Run-specific settings and 127.0.0.1 for backend connection
- Fixed hardcoded URL in `search.html` to use dynamic API endpoint instead of hardcoded localhost

### 2. Backend Upgrades
- Created `app/.env.cloud` for backend configuration in Cloud Run
- Updated `Dockerfile` to copy both frontend and backend .env.cloud files during build
- Enhanced `vector_store.py` to properly initialize Qdrant connection from settings:
  - Now uses settings from config.py 
  - Added support for Qdrant Cloud API key
  - Better error handling for connection issues
- Ensured backend uses correct ports and hosts in Cloud Run environment

### 3. Documentation
- Updated `CLOUD_RUN_GUIDE.md` with detailed instructions for:
  - Environment file configurations
  - Qdrant setup options (self-hosted and Qdrant Cloud)
  - Troubleshooting guidance for common issues

### 4. Architecture Optimizations
- Using single container with supervisord for both frontend and backend
- All internal communication now uses 127.0.0.1 for better security and reliability
- Proper service startup order (backend before frontend)

## Testing Required
To verify the changes are working correctly:

1. Build and deploy the container to Cloud Run
2. Verify frontend can connect to backend within Cloud Run
3. Confirm Qdrant connection works properly
4. Test the full user workflow from login to search
5. Check authentication and search logs for any issues

## Future Improvements
- Add health check endpoints for both frontend and backend
- Implement autoscaling configuration based on traffic patterns
- Add more detailed Cloud Run-specific logging and monitoring
